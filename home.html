      <p class="title">The Technique Behind the Mic</p>
      <p>Many have come and touched mics amongst some of the best to ever do it. From unique ones like Charles Hamilton, all the way to artists with amazing stage prescence like Ghostface their technique is their bread and butter. Here's an example of some battle rap to give you and idea of the heights lyrics can be brought.<br /><br /> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B8GaiBR-IKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
			<p>
				Pictured above, is Loaded Lux, one of battle raps most well known and respected to have gone through the rounds. Although Lux isn't breaking radio records, he's still a strong part of what is a diverse community. There are plenty of battle rap scenes across the US for example, GrindTimeNow takes place over at Austin's Coffee in Orlando.

      <p class="title">Quick Background</p>
      <p><strong>Hip Hop</strong> is usually talked about like some giant in the mountainside that we have no sort of control over. When hip hop began in the 70s, barely anyone was actually involved in the movement. Created from some of the poorest districts across NYC around the same sort of scene that also carried <strong>breakdancing</strong> and <strong>graffiti tagging</strong> Many of these young cats were simply unemployed and finding work around the city at discos after learning how to deejay. Set up on usually two turntables and a DJ mixer to pump out the jams non-stop</p><br />As rapping became more popular, more <strong>DJ</strong> and MC duos formed. As the competition grew, DJs began improving their beats by using techniques like sampling short drum breaks and scratching. MCs also began improving their raps by using more complex rhymes and by developing flow, or the ability to rap with a good sense of rhythm and a natural flowing style. Hip hop music was only performed live at first, but in 1979 a hip hop single called Rapper's Delight by <strong>The Sugarhill Gang</strong> was released, and to everyone's surprise it became a top-ten hit worldwide.<br/ ><br />
			After the success of Rapper's Delight, many other hip hop records were released like Kurtis Blow's The Breaks and Afrika Bambaataa's Planet Rock. Most of these songs were about having fun, but in 1982 <strong>Grandmaster Flash</strong> and the<strong> Furious Five</strong> released The Message, an early example of socially-conscious hip hop. It had a slow funk groove with melodic synthesizer riffs and the raps were about social issues like poverty, crime and the stress of living in a dangerous city.
